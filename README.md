MayaDevUtil
==============

A collection of template to help the creation of Maya plugin by providing templates for project create using either cmake, Qt or Xcode.

Debugging with Xcode:
- Set scheme executable to Maya.app/Contents/bin/maya. Might need to manually edit the project file.
- Had problems with LLDB and currently using GDB
- Arguments are useful (-file and -script) and work best with full path from /
